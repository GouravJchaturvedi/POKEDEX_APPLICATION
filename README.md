# POKEDEX_APPLICATION

This is a Pokedex application that allows users to search for Pokémon and view detailed information about their height, weight, and type.

This application uses the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon details such as height, weight, type, and abilities, and displays them on the application's dashboard using React.js.

## Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
